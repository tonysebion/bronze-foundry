"""Support utilities and non-test artifacts for the `tests/` tree.

This module holds package-level helpers and documentation that should not
be discovered as tests during `pytest` collection. We moved the minimal
module docstring which previously lived at `tests/__init__.py` here to
reduce confusion about which files are tests.
