# STORAGE CONFIGURATION
# Platform/infrastructure settings - controls where data is read from and written to
# Easy toggle between local filesystem and S3 storage
# ============================================================================
storage:
  # SOURCE: Where to read source files from
  source:
    backend: s3  # "local" or "s3"
    bucket: source_data  # For S3: bucket name or reference from environment config
    prefix: source_samples/  # Base path prefix within bucket (or base directory for local)

  # BRONZE: Where to write Bronze chunks
  bronze:
    backend: s3  # "local" or "s3"
    bucket: bronze_data  # For S3: bucket name or reference from environment config
    prefix: bronze_samples/  # Path prefix within bucket (or base directory for local)

  # SILVER: Where to read Bronze and write Silver artifacts
  silver:
